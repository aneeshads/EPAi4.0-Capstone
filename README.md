## Introduction
## myfaker
_myfaker_ is an add-on for Blender, which can be used to generate data using the _Node_ _Editor_ in Blender. _myfaker_ simulates the faker library and provides 'Provider' nodes, 'Generator' nodes and configurations for the end user to select. _myfaker_ can be added to Blender and the node editor can be used to configure the node settings; the output data is generated and displayed in the console. This version of _myfaker_ is compatible with Blender _version_ _3.0.0_ </br> </br>

## Demo
Click on this link to view a video demonstration of myfaker: [Video demo of myfaker](https://youtu.be/l97bJcbhoGs)

## Usage
### 1. Install Faker library in Blender 
Install the _faker_ library in Blender by using the following commands in the Python console available in Blender:
```python
from pip._internal import main
main(['install', 'faker'])
```
### 2. Add the myfaker add-on in Blender
The _myfaker.zip_ can be downloaded into the user's system. In Blender, user can select Edit -> Preferences -> Add-ons -> Install and then install the zip file. One can also download the code and zip the contents to generate _myfaker.zip_</br> </br>

### 3. Configuring the the Provider and Generator Nodes

#### Access the Faker Node Tree
Access the Faker Node Tree from Blender </br> </br>

#### Add the required nodes and create node links
1. Add the required provider nodes
2. Configure the provier nodes through user inputs available in each node
3. Add the generator node and select the number of records required
4. Link the provider nodes to the generator node </br> </br>

## Features
Providers from the Faker python library has been mapped as '_Providers_' nodes in _myfaker_ add-on, and the following _Providers_ nodes are available for users to generate data:</br>
1. Person </br>
2. Phone </br>
3. Address </br>
4. Social Security Number </br>
5. Geographical location </br>
6. License Plate </br>
7. Credit card </br>
8. Occupation </br>
9. Bank </br>
10. Company </br> </br>

Finally, a _Generator_ node is provided which consolidates inputs from all _provider_ nodes to generate the fake data. User can specify the number of records as an input in the _Generator_ node.

## Description of the project
The '_myfaker_' add-on was created using the '_Blender Python API_' in Blender

### Blender Python API
The Blender Python API provides a framework using nodes, sockets and links for users to create custom add-ons.

#### Nodes
In the current project, each individual nodes represent a data point, whose output is forwarded to a final supra node that conditionally displays the incoming data fields. This implies that the user can choose whether the information being output from a node can be displayed or not.
#### Sockets
The entry of data as well as its forwarding to the next node happens via points housed within panels inside each node. These panels are known as sockets.
#### Links
The connection between individual nodes and the entry points within the sockets happens via links, which are also known as edges.

### Custom Nodes in _myfaker_   
The Python API of Blender and its various other elements described above have been used to create a directional data flow model. The directional data flow model channels the inputsÂ from a source node to a recipient node which has the appropriate socket point to receive the data from the former. In order to ensure that any change of input in the source node is reflected in the recipient as well, appropriate backend codes have been deployed. 

The following Faker providers have been created as custom nodes. </br>
1. address </br>
2. bank </br>
3. company </br>
4. credit card </br>
5. geo </br>
6. job </br>
7. license plate </br>
8. person </br>
9. phone </br>
10. social security number </br></br>

The inputs are captured from the user as properties in custom nodes, and outputs have been defined as custom sockets. The generator node consolidates inputs from all nodes and uses the underlying faker library to generate the fake data. User can specify the number of recordsin as an input in generator node.
